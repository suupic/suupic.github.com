Ruby 社区的小型活动常常比较另类地在周二举办，叫做"Ruby Tuesday", why？

有一种说法是，这来自于一首歌：

"Ruby Tuesday" is a song recorded by The Rolling Stones in 1966, released in January 1967. The song, coupled with "Let's Spend the Night Together", was a number-one hit in the United States and reached number three in the United Kingdom.

有趣的是，ruby社区中一个著名的Gem "[Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/)" 也出自同一张专辑。
